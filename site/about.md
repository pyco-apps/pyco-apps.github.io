# About

<b>PYCO</b> is the company facade for Liam Collod. A French artist
making pictures for 9 years now. He decided a few years ago to learn
the dark art of building software in the hope that it could improve
his craft, but has instead found himself fully absorbed in it with
the consequence of not really crafting pictures anymore.
<br> He hopes to justify this hazardous life path by sharing his
software with others so that maybe, those could actually improve
their craft and still find pleasure in the ever-evolving realm that
is digital art-making.
